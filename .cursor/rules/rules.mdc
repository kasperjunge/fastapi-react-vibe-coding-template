- Use CURRENT_TASK.md to define and track the projectâ€™s ongoing progress at all times.
- Record everything you learn about the codebase in CODEBASE.md, consult it before inspecting source files, and keep it updated whenever the codebase changes so it always reflects the latest state.
- For everything else that the above documents doesn't cover, record useful information and insights in SCRATCHPAD.md so you can reference them across chats and assignments.
- The current OpenAPI schema for the FastAPI backend is automatically dumped to `agent/openapi.json` every time the backend starts, so check there for the latest API endpoints and schemas.
