# Backend Project Structure Documentation

## Overview
The backend is built using FastAPI, a modern Python web framework. The project follows a modular, service-oriented architecture that separates concerns and facilitates maintainability and scalability.

## Architectural Patterns

### Core Module
The `core` directory contains foundational components that support the entire application:
- **api.py**: Configures the FastAPI application, including middleware, exception handlers, and API versioning.
- **database.py**: Manages database connections, sessions, and ORM setup.
- **dependencies.py**: Defines reusable dependencies for dependency injection.
- **settings.py**: Manages application configuration, usually using environment variables.

### Service-Oriented Architecture
The application is organized around service modules in the `services` directory:
- Each service is a self-contained module representing a specific domain or feature.
- Services follow a consistent internal structure:
  - **models.py**: SQLAlchemy ORM models defining database schema.
  - **schemas.py**: Pydantic models for request/response validation and serialization.
  - **routes.py**: FastAPI route definitions and endpoint handlers.
  - **service.py**: Business logic implementation, decoupled from the API layer.

### Entry Point
- **main.py**: Bootstraps the application, imports and registers API routes from each service.

## Best Practices
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between database models, validation schemas, API endpoints, and business logic.
2. **Dependency Injection**: FastAPI's dependency injection system is used for managing database sessions, authentication, and other cross-cutting concerns.
3. **Modular Design**: New features can be added as self-contained service modules without modifying existing code.
4. **Type Safety**: Extensive use of type hints and Pydantic models for validation and documentation.

## Deployment
The project includes a Dockerfile for containerized deployment, making it easy to package and deploy in various environments.

## Dependencies
The project uses FastAPI as its primary web framework, with additional dependencies likely including SQLAlchemy for ORM, Pydantic for data validation, and potentially others for specific functionality.
