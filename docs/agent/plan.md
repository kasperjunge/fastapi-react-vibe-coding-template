## Technical Considerations

### Dependencies to Add
```json
{
  "react-router-dom": "^6.x",
  "react-hook-form": "^7.x",
  "axios": "^1.x",
  "zustand": "^4.x" // or use React Context
}
```

### File Structure
```

├── components/          # Reusable UI components
│   ├── ui/             # Basic UI components (Button, Input, etc.)
│   ├── forms/          # Form components

```

### Key Design Principles
- **Mobile-first responsive design**
- **Accessibility compliance**
- **Clean, minimal aesthetic**
- **Fast loading and smooth interactions**
- **Consistent error handling**

## Getting Started Recommendations

1. **Start with Phase 1**: Set up the foundation properly before building features
2. **Use incremental development**: Test each component as you build it
3. **Focus on one form at a time**: Complete login before moving to signup
4. **Test API integration early**: Don't wait until the end to connect to backend
5. **Keep design simple**: Focus on functionality first, polish later

## Success Metrics
- [ ] User can navigate the landing page smoothly
- [ ] All authentication flows work without errors
- [ ] Forms provide clear feedback and validation
- [ ] Dashboard shows user information correctly
- [ ] Application is responsive on all device sizes
- [ ] Code is maintainable and well-structured

**Total Estimated Time**: 12-20 hours
**Recommended Timeline**: 2-3 days for full implementation

The plan prioritizes getting core functionality working first, then adding polish and optimization. Each phase builds logically on the previous ones, ensuring steady progress toward a fully functional authentication system.
